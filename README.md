# Analyzing-and-Predicting-Credit-Card-Approvals

## Objective
Build a machine learning model to predict if a credit card application will get approved.

## Description

Nowadays, commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this project, I will try to build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do. Essentially, predicting if a credit card application will be approved or not is a [classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification) task. I decide to use Logistic Regression model and to perform Grid Search CV on the Logistic Regression model in order to find the best model.

The dataset used in this project is the [Credit Card Approval dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
